# GitHub Actions Collection

Collection of reusable GitHub composite actions.

Actions:
 - commit-version: update version string(s) in a file and commit the change.
 - docker-build: build & push a single-platform image; outputs a digest artifact.
 - docker-merge: create a multi-architecture manifest from previously built digests.

For full inputs, outputs, and examples see the README (if present) or action.yml inside each directory.
